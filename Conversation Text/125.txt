client: The baby was up all night and I'm exhausted.
therapist: So, what you're saying is you've had a rough night?
client: Yes. She was up every three hours to eat, I don't understand it.
therapist: So, she needed to eat every three hours last night and that was really frustrating for you?
client: Yes. My mom told me that I started sleeping through the night when I was a month old, Lilly is six weeks.
therapist: Hmm. So, based on what your mom told you, you were expecting Lilly at this point to be sleeping through the night?
client: Well, what is normal for a baby this age?
