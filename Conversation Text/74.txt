therapist: Hi, Emily. How are you?
client: I'm doing all right. How are you?
therapist: I'm good. Um, wow, what's changed? What do we have here?
client: Oh, I got my lip pierced.
therapist: Emily, why? Why did you get your lip pierced?
client: Why? I don't know. I wanted a change and-
therapist: You're-
client: -it seems kind of cool
therapist: -gorgeous. Your teeth are lovely. You do not need a piercing.
client: Well, I mean, nobody needs a piercing, I wanted one. It was a-
therapist: Do you know what-
client: -nice change.
therapist: -those oral piercings can do to your teeth?
client: Oh, I mean, it's my lip that's pierced, not my teeth.
therapist: Well, yes, except that, you know what's gonna happen. See how-- Do you feel how when you're moving your lips-- Smile for me. Okay. So, do you see how when your muscles are moving, that piercing is rubbing against your gums-
client: Yeah.
therapist: -as well as your teeth. So, we can see some recession that's gonna start to happen-
client: Yeah.
therapist: -possibly, um, affecting the tooth itself, chipping the tooth, et cetera. So, it's something that we definitely don't like to see.
client: I mean, it's been okay so far. It hasn't caused me any problems.
therapist: Well, it's only been a month.
client: Yeah.
therapist: I think it [unintelligible 00:01:18] days yet, and it might not be a bad idea to reconsider the piercing.
client: I mean, I just put in-
therapist: Just-
client: -I'm not gonna take it right out. It's-- Like you said, I've only had it in for a month, I mean.
therapist: Emily, I've been seeing you for so long and you know that I really just-- I think you have lovely teeth and I've watched you, you know, just mature, et cetera, and I hate-- I'd hate to see you wreck your teeth for something like this. I really would.
client: Well, I mean, if it starts to cause a problem, then maybe we talk about it, but at this point, I mean-
therapist: All right.
client: -it's fine.
therapist: All right. Okay.
client: Yeah.
therapist: Okay.
client: Yeah.
therapist: Okay. We'll continue with the exam, but you know where I stand on this. Okay?
client: All right.
therapist: All right.
client: Yeah.
