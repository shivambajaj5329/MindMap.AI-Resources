therapist: So, what you told me earlier was that you've got into a car with someone you knew had smoked marijuana earlier. What were you thinking?
client: Well, it was raining. I didn't want my science fair project to get wet. I knew my parents wereâ€”
therapist: Science fair project or not, don't you know what happens when someone drives under the influence of marijuana or alcohol? It's bad. They can wreck the car, you can lose your life. I thought you were smart, you're taking AP classes, you wanna get into a Ivy League school. This is not the way you do that.
client: It really wasn't that big of a deal.
therapist: It's a big deal. You can't drink either. You're 16. The drinking age is 21. I think you know that. You could get into an auto crash. Uh, I just wanted you to hear this. I don't' tolerate it as a doctor drinking or driving with somebody who's under the influence, and if you do it again, I'm gonna tell your parents.
client: Okay.
