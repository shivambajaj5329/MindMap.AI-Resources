therapist: So you're sick of this?
client: Yeah. I-I just-- I can't shoplift anymore. You know, I got- I got caught again. And uh, you know, I-I got suspended, I got back to school, so I'm-I'm uh-- I'm gonna mess up my whole life here, unless I can stop this.
therapist: Mm-hmm.
client: Yeah, it's bad. My friends and I, we just-- I mean, it's fun and uh-- so I don't know what to do, but I- but I gotta change.
therapist: Okay.
client: I want it.
therapist: So, it sounds like you're ready. You're ready to give this up.
client: Yeah.
therapist: But, maybe the path to doing that isn't so clear.
client: Right. I don't know what I'm gonna do, I got some friends. These guys are-- they're bad news, but they're my friends.
therapist: Mm-hmm.
client: And, uh, and it's fun.
therapist: And it's fun.
client: You know?
therapist: Mm-hmm.
client: Nothing-nothing much else going on that's as fun as this. We go in, we steal these CDs. It was working out fine, butâ€”
therapist: Uh-huh.
