therapist: Thanks for coming back, [unintelligible 00:06:00]. I know last time we talked about, uh, maybe going out and joining some activities in the community-
client: Yeah.
therapist: -to work on meeting some people, so-
client: Yes, I guess.
therapist: -maybe you could tell me about how that's going?
client: Well, I didn't do anything yet. I didn't go-- I know I was gonna go, but I didn't. But, um, I did look at-- there's the YMCA, they've got some classes that I think will be pretty cool to go to, and then there's this yoga class over at the Women's Center that's only like 10 bucks, so I could do that, um-- but I didn't go because I'm really afraid that like what if-- you know, what if no-one likes me? What if I don't have friends in there?
therapist: Yeah, I know you've mentioned that in the past. When we were talking about the pros and cons of going out to one of these activities-
client: Mm-hmm.
therapist: -you really mentioned that anxiety-
client: Yeah.
therapist: -is a big con.
client: Yeah.
therapist: I remember that.
client: Yeah, but I'm gonna do it anyway, because this is what I need to do to make-- you know, to make friends.
therapist: Okay. To make a change-
client: Yeah.
therapist: -that you've wanted for some time.
