client: You know that my friends were happy, um, that I'm like this cool person who moved from in the middle of nowhere, has a strange accent that-
therapist: Mm-hmm.
client: -they like all my stories, they are really receptive-
therapist: Mm-hmm.

therapist: Okay.
client: That one I haven't shared yet.
