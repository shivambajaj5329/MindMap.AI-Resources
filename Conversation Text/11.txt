Um, what else would you like me to know about you and your perspective that you think will help me work with you over this time?
client: I just wanna get whatever I need to get done, done.

Well, I'm wondering then if it's okay with you and-and I have a form that we can use if you'd like, um, just to put out some different ideas on an agenda that we could share as we're working together so that I-I can support you to be successful in getting this behind you. Would-would this feel like a natural time to-to move towards figuring out where we might go together?
