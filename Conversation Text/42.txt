client: I don't know, I'm just having a lot of hard trouble trying to lose the rest of the weight. Um, right now, it's like no matter how much I try to exercise, run, or whatever, it doesn't matter like nothing else is coming off.
therapist: Right, so you've hit a plateau in your weight and despite all the things that you're trying to do to increase your activity, it doesn't seem to be working on the scale?
client: No, and I don't know what I'm doing wrong because I keep trying the exercise but nothing's happening.

client: Yes.
therapist: And you're not feeling so good about that?
client: No, and even when I'm coming home, like, I'll go to the gym and then I'm noticing nothing is happening and I'll come home and I try to talk to my mama about it or even my father, and no one even cares about it. Like no one wants to support in it anyway.
therapist: Uh, so you feel like you're doing this all alone?
client: Yes.
therapist: At home or you think that they'll be supportive but they're not giving- they're not giving you what you need?
client: No, and specifically my father, he just-- Not only does he not want to support me with it but at the same time, he feels like I need to be gaining my weight back.
therapist: Oh, okay.
client: So Iâ€”
therapist: Tell me about that.
