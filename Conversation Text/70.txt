therapist: Hi, Dr. Martin. I'm Lori. I'm the pharmacist on duty here today. I understand that you have some questions about the medication citalopram. Do you have a minute to talk about that?
client: Yeah, I do, just a couple of minutes though.
therapist: All right. Well, do you have any specific questions?
client: Um, nothing specific. I just am unfamiliar with the medication.
therapist: Okay. Well, citalopram is an SSRI medication. Its indication is for depression and it's typically dosed as a 20-milligram tablet but it is available as 10, 20, and 40 milligrams. Any patients started on this medication should be monitored for improvement in symptoms in four to eight weeks.
client: Okay. Uh, what about side effects?
therapist: If there are some side effects to this, it can include GI effects, sedation, or sexual dysfunction. But if you have a patient that suffers from any of those things, you can try either decreasing the dose or changing them to a different agent. Do you have any other questions?
client: Um, what about does it interact with phenelzine?
therapist: Oh, that I'm not sure of. Um, can I get back to you later on this afternoon with that answer?
client: Oh, sure.
therapist: Fantastic. Thank you.
client: Thank you.
