therapist: Hi, Dr. Martin. I heard you had a question for me. What did you want to talk about?
client: I'm sorry, but are you the pharmacist? I just had a question about citalopram.
therapist: Yeah, I'm the pharmacist on duty. Citalopram, okay. It's an antidepressant and it comes in 10, 20, and 40-milligram strengths. It's excreted in the urine and it has a half-life of about 35 hours. For side effects, there are sexual side effects, heart side effects, and stomach side effects.
client: Okay, but I just wanted to know if it interacts with phenelzine?
therapist: Oh, um, yeah, I think that should be fine.
client: Okay, thanks for that. I have an appointment to run to.
therapist: All right, thanks. Call me anytime.
