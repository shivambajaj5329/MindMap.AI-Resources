client: Many people have told me, um, if I quit smoking, I'm going to gain weight.
therapist: Mm.
client: Well, food really doesn't taste good, but they say it tastes much better-
therapist: Mm-hmm.
client: -if you quit smoking.
therapist: Mm-hmm.
client: Now the downside to that is I'm gonna gain weight.
therapist: Mm-hmm.
client: That means a new wardrobe, which I'd like to have, but I can't afford it.
therapist: Okay. So right now you're seeing that it's a part of your life. It's been a part of your life off and on for 18 years.
client: Mm-hmm.
therapist: It's become a more important part of your life because you found yourself smoking at times that you thought I'll never smoke then.
client: Right.
therapist: Yeah. And your worry is that if you stop, you will end up gaining weight. So I'm hearing this kind of list of things that don't feel so positive about stopping.
client: Mm-hmm.
therapist: I'm wondering what else might be on that list.
client: Um, withdrawal.
therapist: Mm.
client: They say it's awful. Um, being cranky.
therapist: Mm-hmm.
client: And if I do go through this, I just hope my friends understand and will support me in what I'm trying to do.
therapist: Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. So added to the other list is the having to go through the withdrawal-
client: Mm-hmm.
therapist: -the unpleasantness of that. Okay. What else might be on the, not so good side about smoking- about stopping?
client: Um, I think everything's on the bad side about smoking, but, um, I've just smoked so long. I-I just can't imagine-
therapist: Mm-hmm.
client: -not- going through life without smoking.
therapist: Mm-hmm.
client: I know I've got to stop. Uh, I'm having no health problems from cigarettes-
therapist: Mm-hmm.
client: -at present, but when the doctor told me this morning what could be waiting for me in the future-
therapist: Mm-hmm.
client: -that made me rethink-
therapist: Mm.
client: -everything.
